# YouTube-DataAnalysis
As a former data science student, I always wondered which YouTube channels were the best for understanding data analytics. This curiosity motivated me to undertake this project to analyze and identify the top channels in the field.



## Project Overview

- **Data Collection:** This project leverages the YouTube Data API to collect and analyze data from various YouTube channels.
- **Key Metrics:** We focus on metrics such as subscriber count, view count, and video count to assess the popularity and engagement levels of these channels.
- **Data Visualization:** We visualized the top 10 channels based on the number of subscribers, views, and videos uploaded. Here's an example:

- **Segmentation Analysis:** We categorized channels into large, medium, and small segments based on subscriber count. We then analyzed the growth and distribution of channel age within these segments to understand trends and patterns.
